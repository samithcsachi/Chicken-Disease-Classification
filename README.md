# Chicken Disease Classification

In this project we are developing Flask Application which can predict whether the Chicken has effected with Coccidiosis Disease. This is an end to end Machine learning portfolio project which involves the Model Development and Model training. Machine Learning Project is implemented with MLOps and CI/CD pipelines. MLOps consists of Data Ingestion, Data Transformation, Model Trainer, Model Evaluation and Model Deployment.
